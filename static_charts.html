            <h2>Loan Grade Counts</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/loan_grade_counts_updated.png" alt="Bar chart showing loan grade counts" width="600">
            <p>This figure illustrates the distribution of loans across various credit grades, which indicate the creditworthiness or risk associated with each loan. Loan grades, ranging from A to G, 
                are assigned based on factors such as the borrowerâ€™s credit history, income stability, and repayment capacity, with A representing the lowest risk and G the highest risk. 
                The bar chart shows that the majority of loans are concentrated in grades A and B, suggesting that most borrowers fall into low-risk categories. 
                As the grades progress from C to G, the number of loans decreases, with very few loans assigned to the riskiest grades (F and G). 
                This trend indicates a preference for lending to higher-quality borrowers, while loans with higher risk are less commonly issued.
            </p>
            <p>To better understand how loan grade is correlated with default risk, lets visualize the proportion of loans that default based on grade.  
            </p>

            <h2>Loan Status by Loan Grade</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/loan_status_by_grade_updated.png" alt="Bar plot of loan status by grade" width="600">
            <p>This figure is a stacked bar chart that illustrates the proportion of loans categorized by loan grade (A through G) and their corresponding loan statuses (non-default and default). Loan grades represent the credit risk of a loan, with A being the lowest risk and G the highest. 
                Loan statuses indicate whether a loan was repaid as agreed (non-default) or failed to meet repayment obligations (default). The chart shows that for higher-quality grades (A and B), 
                the proportion of non-default loans is significantly higher, indicating lower default rates. As the grades move from C to G, the proportion of defaults increases markedly, 
                with F and G having the highest default rates. This pattern demonstrates a clear correlation between loan grade and repayment performance, emphasizing the importance of credit risk 
                assessment in lending decisions.
            </p>
            <p>Now that we have visualized how default rates differ by grade, lets look at the interest rates the correspond to loan grade.
            </p>

            <h2>Correlation Heatmap</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/correlation_heatmap.png" alt="Correlation heatmap between financial variables" width="600">
            <p>The heatmap illustrates the relationships between key variables like income, loan amount, and default loan status. High correlation is observed between credit history length and age.

                <br>Next, we examine how income affects interest rates to uncover additional trends.
            </p>

            <h2>Interest Rate vs Income</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/interest_rate_vs_income.png" alt="Scatter plot of interest rate vs income" width="600">
            <p>This scatter plot shows the relationship between loan interest rate and borrower income, segmented by loan default status.
                
                ADD FURTHER ANALYSIS
                
                <br>The final chart explores how interest rates vary by loan grade, providing a comprehensive view of financial risk.
            </p>

            <h2>Interest Rate Boxplot by Loan Grade</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/interest_rate_by_grade.png" alt="Box plot of interest rate by loan grade and status" width="600">
            <p>Boxplots demonstrate that lower-grade loans (i.e. F and G) have higher interest rates, with visible differences by default status.
