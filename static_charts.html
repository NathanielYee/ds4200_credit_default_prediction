            <h2>Loan Grade Counts</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/loan_grade_counts.png" alt="Bar chart showing loan grade counts" width="600">
            <p>This bar chart highlights the distribution of loans across different grades (A-G). Grades A and B dominate, suggesting better financial risk profiles.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Heatmap</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/correlation_heatmap.png" alt="Correlation heatmap between financial variables" width="600">
            <p>The heatmap illustrates the relationships between key variables like income, loan amount, and default loan status. High correlation is observed between credit history length and age.</p>

            <h2>Interest Rate vs Income</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/interest_rate_vs_income.png" alt="Scatter plot of interest rate vs income" width="600">
            <p>This scatter plot shows the relationship between loan interest rate and borrower income, segmented by loan default status.</p>

            <h2>Loan Status by Loan Grade</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/loan_status_by_grade.png" alt="Bar plot of loan status by grade" width="600">
            <p>Default rates are higher for lower grades (D-G). Higher-grade loans (A-B) generally show lower default risks.</p>

            <h2>Interest Rate Boxplot by Loan Grade</h2>
            <img src="static_plots/interest_rate_by_grade.png" alt="Box plot of interest rate by loan grade and status" width="600">
            <p>Boxplots demonstrate that lower-grade loans (i.e. F and G) have higher interest rates, with visible differences by default status.</p>
