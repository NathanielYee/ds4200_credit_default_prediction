1. Loan Grade Counts

Marks: 
  Rectangular bars, representing counts for each loan grade.

Channels: 
  Position: Loan grades (A-G) are distributed along the x-axis.
  Height (Position): Encodes the count of each loan grade on the y-axis.
  Color: Uniform blue color used for all bars. A consistent color scheme maintains simplicity and readability aiding visual grouping.

Why this type of visualization was chosen:
  A bar chart is ideal for showing discrete categories (loan grades) and their respective frequencies. 
  It clearly communicates comparisons between categories, making it easier to identify patterns or distributions.

Benefits of This Visualization:
  Clarity: Simple and direct, with no extraneous elements, making it ideal for summarizing categorical data.
  Comparison: The height of the bars makes it easy to compare counts across categories at a glance.

2. Loan Status by Loan Grade

Marks: 
  Rectangular bars, segmented to represent "Non-Default" and "Default" loan statuses.

Channels:
    Position: Loan grades (A-G) along the x-axis.
    Height (Position): Proportion of each loan status along the y-axis.
    Color: Blue for "Non-Default" and orange for "Default" to distinguish the segments.

Why this type of visualization was chosen:
  A stacked bar chart effectively displays the composition of loan statuses within each grade while allowing for easy comparison across grades.
  It highlights the relative proportions of each status, revealing trends such as an increasing proportion of defaults in lower grades.
  The chart allows for a clear comparison of how loan grades impact default rates.

3. Interest Rate by Loan Grade

Marks:
  Box Plots: Used to represent the distribution of interest rates for each loan grade (A to G), separated by loan status (Default or Non-Default).
  Points: Outliers in the data are displayed as individual points beyond the whiskers of the box plots.

Channels:
  X-axis (Position): Represents the loan grades (A to G) as a categorical variable.
  Y-axis (Position): Represents the interest rate as a continuous numerical variable.
  Color: Differentiates between the two loan statuses (Default in blue, Non-Default in red).
  Size: Implicitly conveys the variance and spread in interest rates through the size of the box and whiskers.

Why this type of visualization was chosen:
  Box plots are effective for summarizing distributions and highlighting variations within each loan grade. 
  This helps in identifying trends (e.g., higher interest rates for lower grades) and comparing the distributions for Default and Non-Default loans.
  This type of visualization effectively shows how interest rates vary across loan grades and between Default and Non-Default loans, making it suitable for comparative and distribution analysis.
  Including outliers via points helps in identifying extreme values which might provide insights into atypical loan conditions.

4. Average Income vs Loan Grade

Marks:
  Bars: Represent the average income for each loan grade (A to G).

Channels:
  X-axis (Position): Represents loan grades as a categorical variable.
  Y-axis (Position): Represents the average income as a continuous numerical variable.
  Color: Uniform blue is used across all bars, ensuring simplicity and focus on the height of the bars, which conveys the data.

Justification for This Visualization:
  A bar chart is suitable for comparing discrete categories (loan grades) with a continuous variable (average income). It effectively shows how income varies across loan grades.
  The chart emphasizes differences in average income among loan grades. The rising height of bars demonstrates a clear trend or comparison.

5. Correlation Heatmap

Marks: 
  Cells : Each cell represents a pairwise correlation between two variables.

Channels:
  Position (X-axis and Y-axis): Represents the variables being compared. The rows and columns are arranged to align with the correlation matrix.
  The position of each cell on the grid indicates the pair of variables it represents.
  Color (Hue/Intensity): Encodes the strength and direction of the correlation. A gradient is used to display correlation. Dark blue and dark red indicate strong correlations.

Justification for This Visualization:
  A correlation heatmap efficiently visualizes relationships between multiple variables in a single view.
  The color gradient allows for quick identification of trends and patterns with strong positive or negative correlations that stand out due to intense colors.


Dynamic Visualizations

6. Age and Income with Loan Grade
Marks:
  Scatter Plot: Points representing individual data entries with age and loan-to-income ratio.
  Bar Plot: Rectangular bars representing the count of loan statuses, segmented by loan grade.

Channels:
  Scatter Plot:
  Position:
  X-Axis: Encodes person_age (numerical) for a continuous distribution.
  Y-Axis: Encodes loan_to_income_ratio (numerical), providing a sense of proportionality.
  Color:
  Encodes loan_grade using a color scale (redyellowgreen, reversed), dynamically highlighting points that match the selected filters.
  Unmatched points are shown in lightgrey, emphasizing filtered data.
  Tooltip: Displays details for each point (person_age, loan_amt, loan_int_rate, loan_status), improving interactivity and exploration.

Why This Visualization Was Chosen:
  The combination of scatter and bar plots effectively communicates both individual relationships and aggregated trends within the dataset.
  The scatter plot captures the relationship between person_age and loan_to_income_ratio, categorized by loan_grade, making it ideal for exploring numerical relationships 
  and patterns. Meanwhile, the bar plot provides an aggregated view of loan status distribution, segmented by loan_grade, which is particularly useful for identifying 
  trends within categorical data. Together, these visualizations complement each other, offering both detailed and high-level insights into the data.

Benefits of This Visualization:
  This visualization stands out for its clarity and interactivity. The scatter plot presents continuous variables in a clear, visually appealing manner, while the bar plot 
  summarizes categorical data to enable quick comparisons. The addition of filters, including a range slider for person_age and radio buttons for loan_grade, enhances user 
  control, allowing for tailored exploration of the dataset. By combining detailed relationships with aggregated trends, the visualization ensures comprehensive insights, 
  enabling users to identify patterns and anomalies efficiently.

7. Age and Loan Intent
Marks:
